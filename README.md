# Keylogger
A simple python keylogger built on top of this one: https://www.thepythoncode.com/code/write-a-keylogger-python

## Usage
keylogger.py is the full project with microphone recording and screenshoting. keylogger_text.py is only the keylogging part of keylogger.py

To use them as exes, use pyinstaller and run this command: pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole <filename> after hardcoding your credentials in place of fromAdrr and fromPswd (the from config import isn't necessary a that point)
